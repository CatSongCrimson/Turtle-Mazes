# Turtle-Mazes
Turtle Mazes is a code made for use with the Computer Craft mod. It is a program designed to use random generation to create Mazes without human interaction. Only works on flat surfaces.
- Note: As changes are made, and over time- I will be making additional comments to explain the use of most lines of code and what each function's use is.
